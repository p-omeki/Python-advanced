#Creating a class in python
"""
    class ClassName:
    'Simple documentation of class string ~ This is normally a docstring file describing a small description or documentation of the class'

'''The code above, the statement "class" initiates a class followed by a class name tagged "ClassName" and ecnlosed with a (:).
    The class_suite consist of all the component statement defining class members, attributes and functions.
    Also, we can create a class and assign a property. Check example below.
    
    class MyDigit:
    x =10
    
    In this example, x is the property assigned value 10.
    '''
#Creating instance of class(objects)
'''When creating instance objects, we use __init__(), also known as class contructor and it initializes creation of a new objects in a class.
and parameters are defined within the paranthesis. Check the example below;
       def __init__(name, salary), Now, the name and salary are the parameters.

#Accessing attributes
  ##Check this code below
    '''class Employee:
        'A small documentation on employees'
        empCount=0
        "This would create first employee name and salary"
        emp1 = Employee("Zara", 1000)
        emp1.displayEmployee()
        Now, an attribute is accessed with a dot(.)
        The emp1.displayEmployee() will print access this attribute and print the output: "This would..."
